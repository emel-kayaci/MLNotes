# Data Visualization with Seaborn

## General properties

- Most customization is available through matplotlib Axes objects. 

```
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
sns.distplot(data, ax=ax)
ax.set(xlabel="label", ylabel="label", xlim=(0, 100), title="Title")
```

`ax.axvline(x=10, label="Line")`: Adding line to a graph wherever we need it. 

Seaborn plots create two different types of objects: `FacetGrid` and `AxesSubplot`

- FacetGrid consists of one or more AxesSubplots, which is how it supports subplots. 

Object Type | Plot Types | Characteristics | Title
| :-----: | :-: | :-: | :-: 
FacetGrid | `relplot()`, `catplot()` | Can create subplots | `g.fig.suptitle("Title", y=1.5)`
AxesSubplot | `scatterplot()`, `countplot()`, etc. | Only creates a single plot | `g.set_title("Title")`

`g.set(xlabel="xlabel", ylabel="ylabel")`: Setting x and y labels.

`plt.xticks(rotation=90)`: Since seaborn is built upon matplotlib to change ticks we use plt. 

`sns.set_style()`: White, dark, whitegrid, darkgrid, ticks are some of the sytle options that are available. 

`sns.set(color_codes=True)`: Seaborn supports assigning colors to plots using matplotlib color codes. 

`sns.set_palette()`: Changes colors of graph. Sequential pallets are useful for emphasizing a variable on a continuous scale where colors goes from light to dark. 

Seaborn has 6 fundamental color pallets: deep, muted, pastel, bright, dark and colorblind. To view all pallets use the code given below. (We can also create custom palettes.)

```
for p in sns.palettes.SEABORN_PALETTES:
 sns.set_palette(p)
 sns.palplot(sns.color_palette())
 plt.show()
```

`sns.set_context()`: Changes the scale of the plot elements and labels. Smallest to largest: "paper", "notebook", "talk", "poster"

`sns.despine()`: Removes the lines around the axes called spines. Default is to remove the top and right lines but more can be removed by passing more arguments. 

`plt.clf()`: Clears the plots. 

## 1. Scatter plot

`sns.scatterplot(x="col1", y="col2", data=df)`: We can add additional third parameter `hue`. This will separate categories by color. We can change default order by passing list of our values in `hue_order`. We can change both order and colors using `palette` and pasing dictionary to it. To change only colors pass list of color names to `palette`.

With hue seaborn automatically creates a legend. Below hue is time.

`regplot`: Genmerates a scatter plot with a regression line. `lmplot` generates similar graph but supports more features like where we can plot more than one graph based on `col` parameter value. Plotting multiple graphs while changing a single variable is called `faceting`. `order=2` will attempt a polynomial fit to our data.

`residplot`: A residual plot shows the difference between the observed response and the fitted response values. Useful for evaluating the fit of a model. If the points in a residual plot are randomly dispersed around the horizontal axis, a linear regression model is appropriate for the data; otherwise, a nonlinear model is more appropriate.

Residual is given below:

Residual = Actual (data) - Predicted (from equation)

## 2. Relational plots and subplots

`relplot()`: Enables to visualizate relational relationship between two quantitative variables using either scatter plots or line plots (with `kind` parameter).

- Using relplot() we can create subplots in a single figure with `col` parameter. If we want to arrange these vertically we can use `row` parameter.

- We can use both row and col. By this we can divide plots to 4 captioning 4 different states. 

- With `col_wrap` or `row_wrap` we can set how many plots we want per row. 
 
- With `col_order` or `row_order` we can change order of subplots. 

- With `size` parameter we can change dot size according to some data in scatter plot. For example if we have 4 categories like 0, 2, 4, 6 dots per category will be different size. Common practice is to use same data in hue parameter so colors of dots would be different too. 

- With `style` parameter each category will have different type of points. For example one category will have points shaped like dots while other shaped like x. 

- With `alpha` we can change transparency of points.

### Line plots

If we have more than one measurement for the same x axis value then line plot would create confidence intervals displayed by shaded regions. Lines display the mean values. Confidence interval tells us that based on our data, we can be 95% confident that the mean is within this interval. 

- `ci: "sd"`: Shaded area will show standard deviation of data instead of confidence intervals. 
- `ci: None`: No more shaded area.
- `style`: Adds new data which are represented by different line styles (one normal, one dashed etc.) Common practice is using this with `hue`.
- `markers`: By setting this parameter to True, we can show every data point in line.
- `dashes`: Changes style of lines to normal.

## 3. Catplot

We can use `catplot()` to create different types of categorical plots like count, bar, box and point plots. (with `kind` parameter) Bar plots are similar to count plots but displays mean of quantitative variable per category. 

- `order`: Create list and pass it to order parameter to visualize categories in order that we want. 

- In order to make bars horizontal rather than vertical change the order of data in x, y in bar plot. In count plot instead of x pass the data to y parameter. 

- In `box` plot using `sym=""` will omit the outliers. Also it is useful to change the appearance of outliers. 

- In `box` plot whiskers are by default 1.5 times interquartile range. We can change this by changing `whis` parameter. Also we can give the list to the parameter. For example `[5, 95]` means lower whisker being drawn at the 5th percentile and upper whisher being drawn at the 95th percentile. By setting whisker values to `[0, 100]` we can show min and max values. 

- Point plots show mean of quantitative variable. Vertical lines show 95% confidence intervals. It is similar to line plot but line plots has **quantitative** variable (usually time) on x-axis whereas point plot has **categorical** variable on x-axis. To remove lines that connects mean values set `join` parameter to False. To have the points and confidence intervals be calculated for the median instead of mean set `estimator` parameter to median. We can add caps to the both end of confidence intervals using `capsize` parameter.

## 4. Histogram

```
sns.distplot(data,
             hist=False,
             rug=True,
             kde_kws={'shade':True})
```

- `kde` (kernel density estimation) helps us visualize smooth continous line for histogram. By setting this parameter to True we can see both bars and line. By passing False to `hist` like in example above only line will be shown in graph. Seaborn uses gaussian kernel by default. 

![hist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43893190/162186911-5d5d4faa-05df-47ff-8d03-f7e6f9a9623f.PNG)

- kde plots also can be made with `sns.kdeplot()` showing different density levels. While 1D kde plots consist of lines, 2D kde plots consists of contours. To see what densities represent we can use color bar with `cbar`.

```
sns.kdeplot(data_x,
            data_y,
            color='r', shade=True, Label='label1',
            cmap="Reds", shade_lowest=False)
  
sns.kdeplot(data_x,
            data_y,
            color='r', shade=True, Label='label2',
            cmap="Blues", shade_lowest=False)
```

## 5. Violin plot

`sns.violinplot(data=df, x="col1", y="col2")`: Combination of a kernel density plot and a box plot. (Computationaly expensive to create when large datasets) More quicker version is `lvplot`.

## 6. Heat Maps

`sns.heatmap(pd.crosstab(data_x, data_y, values=data, aggfunc='mean))`: Seaborn's heatmap function requires data to be in a grid format. To achieve this format we can use pandas crosstab() function. 

- `annot=True`: Turns on annotations (values are displayed in each cell). 
- `fmt`: Format option ensures that the results are displayed as integers. 
- `cmap`: Change colors of heatmap.
- `cbar = True`: Display color bar. 
- `linewidths`: Spacing between the cells.
- `center=df_crosstab.loc[1, 2]`: Centering the heatmap colors on a specific value.

Most useful way to use the heatmap is to see correlations in data. Pandas `corr` function calculates correlations between columns in a dataframe. To convert this output to heat map use `sns.heatmap(df.corr())`
