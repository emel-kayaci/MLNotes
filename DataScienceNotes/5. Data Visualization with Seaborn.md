# Data Visualization with Seaborn

## 1. Scatter plot

`sns.scatterplot(x="col1", y="col2", data=df)`: We can add additional third parameter `hue`. This will separate categories by color. We can change default order by passing list of our values in `hue_order`. We can change both order and colors using `palette` and pasing dictionary to it. To change only colors pass list of color names to `palette`.

With hue seaborn automatically creates a legend. Below hue is time.

## 2. Relational plots and subplots

`relplot()`: Enables to visualizate relational relationship between two quantitative variables using either scatter plots or line plots (with `kind` parameter).

- Using relplot() we can create subplots in a single figure with `col` parameter. If we want to arrange these vertically we can use `row` parameter.

- We can use both row and col. By this we can divide plots to 4 captioning 4 different states. 

- With `col_wrap` or `row_wrap` we can set how many plots we want per row. 
 
- With `col_order` or `row_order` we can change order of subplots. 

- With `size` parameter we can change dot size according to some data in scatter plot. For example if we have 4 categories like 0, 2, 4, 6 dots per category will be different size. Common practice is to use same data in hue parameter so colors of dots would be different too. 

- With `style` parameter each category will have different type of points. For example one category will have points shaped like dots while other shaped like x. 

- With `alpha` we can change transparency of points.

### Line plots

If we have more than one measurement for the same x axis value then line plot would create confidence intervals displayed by shaded regions. Lines display the mean values. Confidence interval tells us that based on our data, we can be 95% confident that the mean is within this interval. 

- `ci: "sd"`: Shaded area will show standard deviation of data instead of confidence intervals. 
- `ci: None`: No more shaded area.
- `style`: Adds new data which are represented by different line styles (one normal, one dashed etc.) Common practice is using this with `hue`.
- `markers`: By setting this parameter to True, we can show every data point in line.
- `dashes`: Changes style of lines to normal.

## 3. Count plot and bar plot

We can use `catplot()` to create different types of categorical plots like count and bar plots. Bar plots are similar to count plots but displays mean of quantitative variable per category. 

- `order`: Create list and pass it to order parameter to visualize categories in order that we want.
