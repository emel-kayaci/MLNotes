# Data Visualization with Matplotlib

## General Properties

`fig, ax = plt.subplots()`: The Figure object is a container that holds everything we see on the page.
The Axes object holds the data. Together they make a canvas where we will make our visualization. If non input given this function creates one plot. 

Input like `plt.subplots(3, 2)` will create three rows of subplots and two columns. (total 6 graphs)
Now axes object is no longer one object but an array of axes objects. To add data, we need to index into this object like `ax[0, 0]`. `sharey`:  All the subplots have the same range of y-axis values. 

`ax.plot(x_data, y_data)`: Adding data to axes object. We can call this method again and again to add more data to the same canvas. `marker`: If data is not continuous and but graph is made of connected lines, we can add markers to each data point. `linestyle`: Changes line style for example dashed line. `color`: Changes color of line and marker.

`ax.set_xlabel("x label")`: Labeling the axises. 

`ax.set_title("Title")`: Adding title to graph.
