# Data Visualization with Matplotlib

## General Properties

`fig, ax = plt.subplots()`: The Figure object is a container that holds everything we see on the page.
The Axes object holds the data. Together they make a canvas where we will make our visualization. 

`ax.plot(x_data, y_data)`: Adding data to axes object. We can call this method again and again to add more data to the same canvas.
